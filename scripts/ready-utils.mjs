// ─── ACE: QOL — Registering for a thing that has already happened ───────────
//
// ⚠️🔴 THE SHAPE THAT COST THIRTEEN CONDITION GHOSTS. On 2026-08-12 we learned
// that `Hooks.once("ready")` registered from INSIDE the entry file's own ready
// handler waits on an event already in progress and never fires. Nothing
// throws, nothing logs, and the feature is simply absent. The fix written that
// day was `if (game.ready) run(); else Hooks.once("ready", run);`.
//
// ⚠️ `canvasReady` HAS THE SAME SHAPE AND IT IS EASIER TO MISS. Foundry draws
// the canvas and fires `canvasReady` BEFORE `ready` finishes, so any ACE
// subsystem that starts from a ready handler and then does
// `Hooks.on("canvasReady", …)` has already missed the first firing. It looks
// fine, because the listener DOES fire — on the next scene change. So the
// feature is absent exactly once: on load, which is the only time he is looking
// at a fresh world.
//
// A sweep on 2026-09-05 found 25 of these across the suite.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT `once`. The listener stays registered for every future scene;
// all this adds is the run that was missed. That makes it behaviour-preserving
// everywhere: it can only ADD the first call, never remove a later one.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
